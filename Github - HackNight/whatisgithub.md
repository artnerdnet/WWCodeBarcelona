# What is Git?

Git is a version control system that works as a command-line tool. But what is a version control system? It is any system that lets you register and access the history of a file and how it progressed over time. This allows you to jump back if needed.

Think about it as a super powerful ctrl + zâ€¦ Registering all the changes that you make over time when you are working on a project. Git is just that. 

# So what is the difference between Git and Github?

Github is a development platform that hosts projects using the Git system. It allows developers to upload their code files, share them, see new changes, download them and contribute.
